# Braid HTTP

Redwood is part of the [Braid project](https://braid.org), and uses the Braid protocol to synchronize updates over regular HTTP.

Braid is [currently working through the IETF's RFC process](https://github.com/braid-org/braid-spec) to have its extensions to HTTP standardized (see the [current IETF draft spec](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-toomim-httpbis-braid-http)).
