Redwood is a **highly-configurable, distributed, realtime database** that manages a state tree shared among many peers. Imagine something like a Redux store, but distributed across all users of an application, that offers offline editing and is resilient to poor connectivity.

Redwood is also an **application server**. Developers can store and update assets (HTML, Javascript, images) directly in the state tree. For many types of applications, you may not need a separate backend server at all.

Its flexibility allows developers to use a single, simple programming model to create many divergent classes of applications:

* Traditional web applications
* Realtime collaborative document editors
* Peer-to-peer encrypted messaging
* Blockchains
* Git-style version control systems
