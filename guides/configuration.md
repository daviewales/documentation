# âš™ Configuration

## System configuration

### IPv6

Configuring IPv6 is likely to improve your node's connectivity with other nodes, as long as they're configured to use it as well.

#### Linux

If you are running Redwood as a simple binary (as opposed to within a Docker container) on a Linux machine, the process is straightforward.

First, add the following lines to `/etc/sysctl.conf`:

```
net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 0
net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 0
```

Then, run the following command to activate your changes:

```
sysctl -p
ip6tables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s fd00::/80 ! -o docker0 -j MASQUERADE
```

#### Docker

If the node is running within a Docker container, two additional steps are required. Create a file called `/etc/docker/daemon.json` containing the following:

```json
{
    "ipv6": true,
    "fixed-cidr-v6": "fd00::/80"
}
```

Then, run the following command to activate your changes:

```
systemctl restart docker
```

## Redwood configuration

When Redwood starts for the first time, it will create a configuration file called `.redwoodrc` in the location you specified with the `-c` (or `--config`) flag. It's recommended that you stop Redwood and investigate this file to ensure that your node is configured as you wish.

`.redwoodrc` is a YAML file with the following structure:

```yaml
